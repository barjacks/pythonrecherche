He is not the sole contender: Edwin Vassallo is in the race too. Nominations close at 6pm today. When the Nationalist Party broke the news in a press release a few hours ago, this website rang Chris Said, who Adrian Delia, the party leader, had invited to stand for the post. Dr Said had agreed reluctantly, saying that he would do so only if he is the sole contender. Dr Said confirmed to this website that on the basis of that agreement with the party leader, he will now not stand for election to the post. Mr Vassallo presented no such obstacle, because he has said already that if Dr Said comes forward, he will stand aside. There are two ways of considering this situation. One is that after a weeks of intensive campaigning, David Agius is so determined to become deputy leader for parliamentary affairs that he has defied the party leader’s wish to pull Dr Said on board to make himself look better with disillusioned supporters who are leaving the party in droves. The other is that Mr Agius did not defy his party leader at all, but on the contrary has hatched a scheme with Dr Delia (he is one of his closest allies and collaborators) to keep out Dr Said, who they don’t actually want around, while at the same time making it look like Dr Delia tried to rope him in for ‘unity’. Whichever it is, my considered view is that Dr Said was extremely relieved when Mr Agius, who is not known for his intelligence, threw his hat into the ring at the 11th hour. He would not have wanted to refuse Dr Delia’s invitation outright because it would have come across as querulous, but nor would he want to be embroiled in the evolving mess in the Nationalist Party at a formal hierarchical level. Meanwhile, with just an hour to go until nominations close, Robert Arrigo remains the sole contender for the other deputy leadership role, that for party affairs. Clyde Puli today announced that he wouldn’t be standing for election to that role after all, saying more or less that he respects the party leader’s wish to have one deputy leader from his camp and another who had supported his electoral rivals. When David Agius put himself forward formally for the one role, which meant Chris Said’s exclusion, it followed that the other role could not be taken up by Mr Puli, who is also a close collaborator of Dr Delia’s. It also assumes that Edwin Vassallo is also one of Dr Delia’s backers or that Mr Agius is bound to win against him. Robert Arrigo did not campaign for Dr Delia. The election takes place on 18th November.","

Mrs Delia replied, “Rebecca has been one of my closest and most trusted friends for the past six years. She is always there for me.” Her full answer is in the screenshot below. Promoting the interview on her Facebook page, Miss Dimech refers to the Opposition leader’s wife as “my beautiful Nickie” and then as “oh, my beautiful doll”. Because the Opposition leader has repeatedly posted enthusiastic comments beneath Rebecca Dimech’s provocative poses on Facebook,  Mrs Delia was at pains to dismiss any suspicions people might have had about “infidelity” by telling her interviewer “we laughed our heads off”. The widespread suspicions she needs to address about her and the Opposition leader’s relationship with Miss Dimech, though, have nothing to do with infidelity. Miss Dimech, who works in make-up, is an amateur glamour model from the wrong side of the tracks, whose long-term boyfriend, Andre Falzon (known as Id-Diesel) is a convicted drug-dealer well known to the police. He was released from prison last June. She is also in her early 30s while Mrs Delia is a 45-year-old married housewife with five children, who trained as a lawyer and socialises with a very different set. The Opposition leader himself is at least 15 years older than Miss Dimech. When women are best friends – however unlikely the scenario given that they have nothing in common and move in different worlds, but they say they are best friends – this means that their husbands or boyfriends are unavoidably in constant contact too. In this case, the husband is the leader of the Opposition and the boyfriend is a convicted, lifelong drug-dealer who was released from jail a few months ago.

Or maybe it wasn’t so much an Uzbekistani performance as your standard encounter between two Maltese 50-year-olds: the man ranting on about himself, oblivious to the woman’s glazed-eye boredom because he is convinced of his own power to enthral, and the woman privately thinking what a t**ser he is, and how very unattractive Maltese men become beyond a certain fairly early age, but how she’d better be nice to him because of her husband and because men don’t like women who talk back, so she had better keep nodding and smiling and occasionally opening her eyes wide (which helps with the struggle to stay awake and alert, but which the man helpfully mistakes for fascination). Some people seem thrilled because the new Nationalist Party leader said during his election campaign – but then he would, wouldn’t he – that he wants to “listen to people”. How I laughed. The thought of that man listening to anyone at all is hilarious. My life experience tells me that he’s one of those who talks at people, totally oblivious to whether they are interested and without the slightest interest in hearing what they might have to say when they can get a word in edgeways.

Or maybe it wasn’t so much an Uzbekistani performance as your standard encounter between two Maltese 50-year-olds: the man ranting on about himself, oblivious to the woman’s glazed-eye boredom because he is convinced of his own power to enthral, and the woman privately thinking what a t**ser he is, and how very unattractive Maltese men become beyond a certain fairly early age, but how she’d better be nice to him because of her husband and because men don’t like women who talk back, so she had better keep nodding and smiling and occasionally opening her eyes wide (which helps with the struggle to stay awake and alert, but which the man helpfully mistakes for fascination).Some people seem thrilled because the new Nationalist Party leader said during his election campaign – but then he would, wouldn’t he – that he wants to “listen to people”. How I laughed. The thought of that man listening to anyone at all is hilarious. My life experience tells me that he’s one of those who talks at people, totally oblivious to whether they are interested and without the slightest interest in hearing what they might have to say when they can get a word in edgeways.Smashing Uzbekistan set – all we need are some lurid fake flowers in a gold enamelled urn with plenty of curlicues and fluting.  « previous postnext post »"

He was at the Massimo Dutti shop at The Point shopping mall in Sliema, browsing the rails and trying on suits and shirts. Delia was meant to be at the Palace at 5.15pm for the start at 5.30pm of the official ceremony in which he was sworn in as leader of the Opposition in terms of the Maltese Constitution. Instead, he rolled up casually at 6.40pm, offering no explanation and making no apology. When journalists at the event challenged him about his extraordinary lateness and asked him for an explanation, Delia replied: “This is a time for unity and not for controversies.” He offered no further explanation or even an expression of regret.  The following day, when all the newspapers reported on his extreme tardiness, and how he kept the holders of Constitutional office, including the President, waiting for so long at a ceremony is his own honour, he tweeted “I apologise for taking longer than expected to arrive”, which was widely taken to compound the gravity of the situation because he appeared to make light of it. People who saw Delia shopping for clothes at Massimo Dutti late on Friday afternoon at first thought nothing of it because they had no idea he was meant to be at the Palace in Valletta for his own swearing-in ceremony at that particular time, and would never have imagined that something like that would be possible. But after they read posts on this website saying how late he was for the ceremony, they got in touch to say that it was because he was shopping for clothes. “He was definitely at Massimo Dutti at 5.30pm on Friday,” one of them said. “He was actively shopping for clothes and he had the full attention of the staff, who were showing him suits and shirts. He did not seem rushed or bothered about the time. I would never have dreamed that right at that moment there was a whole room of people waiting for him at the Palace, including the President.” I then rang the Massimo Dutti shop and asked to speak to the manager, who confirmed that the Nationalist Party leader was there on Friday afternoon, that he helped him personally, and that Dr Delia was there to specifically to select “a suit, shirt and tie” for his official swearing-in ceremony.  The manager, who is not Maltese, seemed unaware that the ceremony was to take place that same afternoon, and was meant to be taking place even as the Nationalist Party leader was choosing his outfit. The manager could not be specific on what time Dr Delia was there and how long he spent in the shop. “It was after 4pm,” he said. “Four, five o’clock, something like that. I don’t remember exactly.” I rang the Nationalist Party leader on his personal mobile phone for his comments, but he did not pick up or return my calls. So I sent him the following message, to which he did not reply either: Last Friday at 5.30pm you were shopping for clothes at Massimo Dutti at The Point in Sliema, while the head of state, Chief Justice, Attorney-General and your own people from the Nationalist Party waited at the Palace in Valletta to have you sworn in as Opposition leader. What is your explanation for your otherwise inexplicable decision to do something so crazy? So I rang the Nationalist Party’s head of communications, who has always been super-efficient in handling questions from the press. (Sadly, though not for him, he leaves the Nationalist Party and Malta in a month and will be replaced by a Delia apparatachik.) He took my question to the party leader and was back in minutes with the reply: “Adrian Delia has nothing further to add to the tweet he published on Saturday.” Adrian Delia, wearing the suit, shirt and tie he bought at Massimo Dutti in Sliema while the President. Chief Justice, Attorney-General and Nationalist Party MPs and officials waited for him for 90 minutes.","

Adrian Delia had just been elected leader of the Nationalist Party. I had no surveys to work off but only years of experience in writing about Maltese political behaviour and an obvious understanding of how a big chunk of the Nationalist Party’s core support thinks. My own views are not at all unusual, as those who would undermine me seek to make out. They are actually pretty typical of a great, big, key category of electors and that’s exactly why I have the readership I do: I understand my audience and the fact that I am one of them. I had spent the past few weeks writing about how the Nationalist Party would be scripting its suicide note by making Delia its leader, not only because he himself is a knave but, crucially, because when the party allows itself to be hijacked by anybody walking in from the outside, it looks weak, vulnerable and structurally disorganised. And that means people won’t feel safe trusting it to run the country. Also, the very fact that people as sub-standard as Delia and Frank Portelli were allowed to stand for the leadership election at all has decimated people’s trust in the Nationalist Party’s ability to maintain standards, let alone set them.  It talks about safeguarding standards in public life and protecting important state and government roles from poisoning by terrible appointees, and then it can’t even safeguard itself from leadership candidates who include a bankrupt to the tune of many millions and a sleazy lawyer who is as slippery and evasive as a skink. I put my point of view across in person, too, to people in the Nationalist Party, or connected with it, who support Delia and actively worked for his election as party leader.  “I’m damned if I’m ever going to vote to make that man prime minister,” I said, “or even feel any kind of support for the Nationalist Party as long as he and his chimps and assorted root vegetables lead it. And that means that thousands of other people are going to be doing and feeling the same because my thinking may not be typical on a nationwide scale, but when it comes down to a crucial category of people who vote Nationalist, it most definitely is. The way I’m feeling, they’re feeling that way too.” If I had Mrs Delia’s strange and frivolous mind-set, I would now say that I feel vindicated.  Instead I feel angry at the mindless stupidity and rabid personal ambition – a combination of factors that is a predictor for catastrophe – that have caused this.  Two days ago, Malta Today published a survey  that shows how the vote-gap between the two political parties has actually doubled, from 36,000 to 73,000.  My instinctive understanding on the day of Delia’s election that the gap had shot to 60,000 had been correct – probably because it was not ‘instinct’ at all but a real understanding of how the people for whom I write actually think, for no other reason than that I am like they are. I have no idea whether the survey results caused a panic in Delia’s hen-house, or whether it has begun to dawn on the more sensible people around him, who may perhaps have been blinded originally by other factors, that the only thing to do now with what they thought was their prize cock is to wring his neck and broil him for supper.  Some people have begun to acknowledge in private that they were wrong – it takes a big person to do this, and far too many protect their ego by sticking to their guns instead of using those guns to shoot their cock Delia. One or two people who supported Delia, and who probably still like him at a personal level, now see in the face of those survey results that the fact that they like him doesn’t mean Nationalist Party voters do. To understand how a Nationalist Party voter thinks, ideally, you have to be one. Otherwise, you are more likely to understand how a particular segment of Labour voters think, and that is not what is useful here. Whichever way I look at it, it’s a disaster. Some people who are active within the Nationalist Party have defended their choice to stay on by saying that they can’t leave the party to be taken over entirely by the invading parasites, that they have to fight from within.  Fine, I say, as long as this ‘fight from within’ has one sole aim, which is to defenestrate Delia and his collaborators immediately the Nationalist Party is wiped out in the European Parliament elections in 2019. Because if that doesn’t happen, what are they going to do in the three years which follow – campaign for the Nationalist Party to win the 2022 general election with Delia as leader, and vote in that election to make him prime minister? How do you ‘fight against’ somebody and then at the end of it all vote for him and the party he leads? It makes no sense. And that is exactly why I and a big chunk of those who voted Nationalist in the last general election now say that we won’t be voting at all: because we don’t want Delia to become prime minister and we no longer trust the political party which was crazy and disorganised enough to allow him and Frank Portelli to be contenders in its leadership election, and a party which was so lacking in political insight and so unable to read the runes that its people actually chose Delia. People with such poor judgement can’t be trusted to take their aged mother or grandmother out for a walk in the park. My post on 17th September","

We don’t need to see him in his vest on a Sunday morning or flipping burgers on a barbecue.And why was the wedding mass in English when the groom’s side of the family can’t speak the language? It strikes me as very bad manners.It’s going to be a walkover.  « previous postnext post »"

He did not ring to correct any reported facts, but to object to being placed in the limelight: “Leave me alone and I’ll leave you alone. What have I ever done to you? Why do you want to harm me?” I explained that this is not personal and that news reporting and commentary is not the business of doing harm to those who are reported on or written about, but the business of keeping the public informed. Why can’t I go to my friend Keith Seychell’s party, he said, and why did you publish that photo?  What business is it of yours or anybody else’s?  You’re right – it wouldn’t have been any of our business if two members of the cabinet, including the Environment Minister, and the former director of operations at the VAT Department, now installed at the Inland Revenue, were not also in the picture with you and your host. But they are. That makes it very much a public-interest matter, especially on the eve of the Planning Authority vote on your illegal zoo. I do a lot of charity, Mr Cutajar said. Do you know how much charity I do? No doubt, I said, but then so does the Mafia. Are you comparing me to the Mafia? I’m not the Mafia, he said. I never said that you are, I replied, but I’m pointing out that crime, flouting the law and acts of charity are not mutually exclusive, that charity is a separate issue and that acts of charity do not justify or excuse building a full-on zoo without planning permission and operating it in defiance of the law. I am a very big millionaire, he said. Do you have any idea how much money I have? I don’t need to justify myself with anyone.  That’s exactly the problem, I said. You think that because you have lots of money you can do what you please, that you are more equal than others before the law, and unfortunately, you’re being proved right on that. You’ve been expanding your illegal zoo for years while flaunting your relationship with the Prime Minister and other government politicians, and communicating the message that so what if you’re breaking the law in a big way, you’re a rich man and you’re mates with the Prime Minister. Why can’t I have a zoo if I want to, he said.  Nobody’s saying you can’t have a zoo if you want to, I said – not even the Planning Authority, which has just told you that you can keep your zoo. I’m telling you something else: that the thing to do is first get a planning permit and then build your zoo, and not the other way round. That’s how it works for lesser mortals who aren’t rich men who are mates with the Prime Minister and his wife. If we went round setting up illegal zoos we would have the police on our case in no time. Have you ever been to my place, he asked rhetorically. No, I said, and I don’t wish to, so please don’t invite me.  Don’t you like animals, he said. Of course I do, I said, and I also hate cages of any kind, type or size. People who love animals know they should be in their natural habitat, not under great stress in a small cage being gawked at by crowds. Animals belong in nature, not in your cages. And that was the end of the conversation, which was reasonably civilised despite everything.

No, of course not.Should schoolchildren be given a live demonstration on how it pays the defiant to openly flout the law alongside their money and their friendship with people in power, because it gets you what you want in the end? No, of course not.Maltese society has become beyond appalling. Others watch, aghast, at what is happening and how it is treated as entirely normal.Anton Rea Cutajar, the owner of the extensive zoo development which has flouted the law for years while Mr Cutajar flaunts his relationship with the Prime Minister (pictured).  « previous postnext post »"

The party was hosted by the restaurant’s director, Keith Seychell, to mark his birthday.  Other guests included Silvio Parnis, parliamentary secretary for local government and communities, businessman and former owner of Global Capital Chris Pace, who now owns an estate agency, and Ivan Portelli, a former policeman who was sacked from the force in 1999 for associating with suspected smugglers under investigation by the police (he continues to associate with one of them until today), and who was appointed Director of Operations at the VAT Department by the incoming Labour government in 2013. He has since been taken off those responsibilities and made Director/Administration at the Inland Revenue Department instead. Today, at the time of publication of this post, the Planning Authority is in session to decide whether to sanction Mr Cutajar’s illegal zoo or not. UPDATE: The Planning Authority has decided to sanction the illegal development and zoo operation  despite objections from NGOs. Mr Cutajar, whose father Joseph is the mayor of Birzebbuga and was also a Labour Party candidate on the Fifth District in this year’s general election, has been expanding and operating his zoo with what appears to be complete immunity to the law, advertising its services – which include having your picture taken with big cat cubs – and socialising routinely with the Prime Minister, who he describes in Facebook posts as his greatest friend, with the Prime Minister’s wife, with the government’s head of communications Kurt Farrugia, and with Economy Minister and Labour Party deputy leader Chris Cardona. Two years ago, I published this post.  Not long after that, I rang Mr Cutajar to ask him to confirm or deny reports that I had received that the Prime Minister had been a guest at his illegal zoo premises, saying to him that the Prime Minister’s car had been noted parked outside by somebody walking their dog. Mr Cutajar denied it, becoming hostile and aggressive.  The Prime Minister is the cabinet member directly responsible for land-use planning and for the Planning Authority. Shortly afterwards he rang back, apologised for his hostility, and thanked me for calling him to confirm before publication. He also referred back to my post in which I asked where he gets the money for his fast cars, extensive land and large number of big cats which cost a daily fortune to feed and maintain, given that he has no obvious source of income, no family money and is barely literate.  He explained that he makes his money through a highly lucrative business which breeds big cats like lions, leopards and tigers in captivity for export to the Gulf States, where they are prized as status symbols by sheikhs and other potentates. This website was unable to ascertain whether this business is registered in Malta or not, and whether the cubs bred in Mr Cutajar’s illegal zoo in Siggiewi are among those exported to the Gulf as status symbols for sheikhs.

Giving their support to the Nationalist Party was the best way they could think of to oppose that corruption. In other words, those 3,000 people did not join the Nationalist Party to support a political football team, or because they liked the leader’s face, but because they wanted to fight the government.

Undeterred, he walked back down Prince of Wales Road – apologies, Manwel Dimech Street – walked unmolested across the Ferries and headed towards Café Giorgio for a proper coffee, as he only drinks Nescafe when he mixes with “the simple Maltese” in village clubs and pretends to share what he thinks of as their simple pleasures.The photographs are those chosen by the Nationalist Party media for publication, which means they are the best available. The Nationalist Party’s two members for Sliema, Karol Aquilina and Marlene Farrugia – at law, and according to a ruling of the Courts of Justice, Dr Farrugia won her seat for the Nationalist Party – were conspicuous by their absence. Both of them are grievously at odds with Delia.Familiar Sliema PN faces were absent too. The only recognisable faces were those of Sliema candidate and Delia convert Ivan Bartolo, the ubiquitous lackeys Jean Pierre and Kristy Debono, and Robert Arrigo, who actually won the Sliema seat which Aquilina then took in a casual election after Arrigo, who had also won a seat in another constituency, vacated it.  « previous postnext post »"

Let’s put it this way, when you’re born ungifted and with such low firepower between your ears, and are lazy with it, your choices for making your own way in life are pretty limited. So your best option is to become a professional courtier in the salon of whoever currently rules the roost – which for most of Puli’s adult life was the Nationalist Party, until Something Bad happened in 2013. He got his permanent seat on the gravy train, which he continues to milk safe in the knowledge that it will never run dry. He is a public relations man at the Foundation for Medical Services,  a sinecure he got through corrupt cronyism through his involvement with the Nationalist Party/government.  He continues to draw a salary there still, even though he never goes in to work, and the government does nothing about it because the Labour Party also has its own politicians with state sinecures who don’t feel the need to report for work either. They’ve sorted it out between themselves: you say nothing about ours and we’ll say nothing about yours. When the Nationalists were re-elected in 2008, the awful and useless Clyde Puli was made a parliamentary secretary for sport, helping to hammer further nails into the PN coffin (and this is one of the ‘new faces’ with which Adrian Delia will supposedly be sweeping through his New Way of change and his break with the past). His ‘job’ at the Foundation for Medical Services was kept open for him and he slid back comfortably into it in 2013. When he became PS for Sport, straight away, his first thought was how to use his position to freeload. He was appointed in March and in August he went off to China with his wife and son to watch the Olympics,  charging everything but his wife’s and son’s airfares to the public purse, and staying for an eyebrow-raising 16 days.  This is what I wrote about the incident, nine years ago, involving Adrian Delia’s ‘new face of change’ Clyde Puli: It’s a good thing the Olympics fell somewhere around Santa Marija, because that was Clyde Puli’s summer holiday sorted. He’s going to have lots of interesting stuff to write about when the school term begins and he’s given the obligatory essay title, What I Did On My Summer Holiday.  In his role as Parliamentary Secretary for Sport, he set off for China and spent 16 days there with his wife and son, whose airfares he paid out of his own pocket, we are told, though no mention was made of who paid for their hotel accommodation and meals (the Chinese?). Nobody would have a problem with a parliamentary secretary for sport going to watch the Olympic Games, but Clyde has made it seem a little too much like he grabbed the opportunity for an extended family jaunt dressed up as work, funded by somebody else. “It was a good opportunity for networking,” the ministry said. Funny how that’s invariably the excuse. Take my advice, Clyde: if you want to go on holiday with your wife and son, take leave of absence from work and do so privately. A 16-day working trip to China for the Olympic Games when you’re the mere Parliamentary Secretary for Sport for Malta (where?) is a little pretentious, though it might be considered crucial to maintain a presence while our national athletes trail in last. You know, for moral support. It’s good to know that Clyde’s watching.","

It’s a small form of torture for a variety of reasons which need not be gone into here.I am completely distracted by Delia’s shabby and sloppy comportment. Apparently, nobody at home or at school jabbed him in the back and taught him how to stand and sit outside the comfort of his living-room.At one point, he had one leg slung right across the other at a right angle, showing the television audience the sole of his shoe. Right now, he’s slid down in his chair with his knees akimbo. Hang on a minute, now his other leg is up and over the other at a right angle, but this time we can’t see the sole of his shoe because it’s looking at the studio wall.Now he’s shifted sideways and is leaning heavily against the back of the chair. I’m struggling with the urge to fly through the television screen, wrench his shoulders back, slap him between the shoulder-blades, bark out “Sit up straight! Spine two inches away from chair back! Legs down and feet together! Sloppy posture, sloppy mind!”The way he slops about tells me a lot about him that I would rather not know.  « previous postnext post »"

And Delia’s own, of course, because he was in no position to bring it up: he would have been met with one of Muscat’s nasty tu quoque responses about his bank account in Jersey, used to launder money for a prostitution racket. And so Delia discussed Air Malta instead, maybe because he thinks it’s a great idea to keep hundreds of people on the payroll of an insolvent airline, and keep adding more too. But then he’s clearly comfortable around debts of millions which can’t be paid.  Note to Delia’s advisers: You need to train him in different camera poses. He’s clearly learned this one by rote and practised it repeatedly in front of the mirror. Now he uses it every time he sees a camera pointed in his direction: throw head slightly back, raise chin (both of which emphasise his slouch and slight stoop), smile with parted lips, and put one leg forward while cocking the other one slightly. He’s beginning to look like an imbecile or worse, like somebody who would push you out of the way to get to the lifeboat first. Teach him some stern expressions with his feet together and his shoulders back. It’s bad enough that nothing else about him inspires confidence, without his having the body language of a conman too.","

She backed down right away, shifting her life to Malta in a way that she was clearly not happy with. Apparently, she had stood for election thinking that she wouldn’t be elected, to help out the Nationalist Party with another solid name on the list, only to find that she had won a seat with barely any canvassing for votes. Now Jean Pierre Debono, who like his wife Kristy campaigned and canvassed hard for his seat and who wanted it really badly, has given it up and instead of being ripped to shreds as Comodini Cachia was, his praises are being sung. Because it is ‘heroic’ to give up your seat – in a slew of scandal about forged signatures on proxy documents – so that somebody who was never in politics, let alone elected politics, can undemocratically become Opposition leader. But it is selfish and a betrayal of your constituents to give up your seat because you would rather be in the far more civilised environment of the European Parliament and Brussels. But if it is wrong and unethical to give up the seat to which you were elected by citizens to represent them in parliament, then it is wrong, full-stop. The only democratically acceptable reasons for giving up your seat in parliament are physical or mental ill health which render you unable to carry out your duties as a member of the House, and when you have been discovered to have been involved in wrong-doing or corruption, or the forgery of signatures on proxy documents. In both those situations, it would be wrong and unethical to keep your seat. In sum, Jean Pierre Debono should indeed resign from parliament, but certainly not for reasons which deserve any praise or description as a heroic act. He should resign because of his involvement in the scandal surrounding those proxy votes. But nobody in the party wishes to point that out, still less the Delia groupies – not because they wish to avoid causing offence to Debono or trouble for him, but because they wish to avoid causing trouble for themselves. Because if the real reason why Debono has got to resign is pointed out, graphically, then the reasons the other candidates on his ballot sheet have given for immediately resigning the seat they will win in the ensuing casual election are overtly unfounded: that they will give up their seat because the only reason Debono is resigning his is so that Delia can become leader. No. The only reason why Debono has to give up his seat is because he is involved in scandal concerning hundreds of suspicious proxy documents. And when you win a seat in a casual election after the source of scandal gives up his, you most certainly do not give it up or you are complicit in this betrayal of democracy and the electorate. I do understand that it is difficult for the individuals involved to withstand the onslaught by Delia’s groupies, now and let alone afterwards if they refuse to give up the seat they win in the casual election. But nobody said politics was easy, and those in the Nationalist Party who entered politics when the party was in the ascendant and in government are particularly susceptible to this belief that politics is about taking the road that makes their life easier within the party itself.  It most certainly is not. Things are very difficult and are bound to become more difficult still. The Delia groupies are busy banging on about glory and victory, like people on drugs in a cult. The reality is that the Nationalist Party’s darkest days are ahead of it, not least because it has elected a man who has racked up huge debts of his own to manage a party that is in a black hole of debt mainly because of its broadcasting stations, and who thinks that he should first start sorting it out by taking a large salary himself – and, no doubt, putting all his hangers-on on the party payroll too. Because he is not in government, so what else can he offer the high priests of his sick cult? Will Adrian Delia be putting Rebecca Dimech on the party payroll too? Surely NET TV needs some decorative items to rival Super One’s. Mario Frendo isn’t sexy and now he isn’t credible either, thanks to the false step of fawning over Delia.","

See below – excerpts from the interview with Adrian Delia, published in The Sunday Times today. You can read the full interview here. He’s going to sell his businesses and use the money to sustain his lifestyle, Delia says. And this when the shares in his various companies, as published in his own statement of affairs, have put his total share value in all those businesses at just €45,000 – enough to cover one year of annual bank interest on his personal loans. When his interviewer asks him why he has no money or savings, Delia says it’s because he has invested all his money in property. Unfortunately the interviewer was not quick enough to respond that no, he has not, because he owes €728,000 (three quarters of a million) to the banks on his property, which he bought with loans that remain outstanding, and on which the annual interest is more than the Opposition leader’s salary. And when the interviewer correctly asked him about the dangerous situation in which a man with a financially dependent wife and five children has no savings or financial fall-back, Delia suddenly introduced health insurance policies and life insurance into the equation. Really? A life insurance policy is an asset, and should have been included in his ‘professionally audited’ statement of affairs, but it was not.  You can use life insurance policies as security for bank loans (the bank will seize the policy and replace the beneficiary if you default) – that’s how much of a tangible asset they are. Keith Schembri does: the published accounts of his Kasco outfit show that his bank loans are partly secured against his personal life insurance policies. Delia’s sudden claim that he has life insurance policies and health insurance policies is not reassuring but rather the opposite. It adds another massive stream of outgoings over and above his school bills, annual bank interest and huge cost of maintaining a wife, himself and five children in the extravagant manner to which they have become accustomed.  Do people out there actually know the cost of an annual premium on health insurance for seven people, five of whom are children? Do they know the cost of monthly payments towards a life insurance policy that is sufficient to financially support a woman and five children for the foreseeable future should the heroic breadwinner suddenly drop dead?  I think not, because ordinary people – the sort who Delia thinks of as “the simple Maltese” – have never encountered the concept of private health insurance in their lives, let alone life insurance. They have no idea of the spending required there. And see below: Delia has told us that he has no intention of changing his lifestyle in terms of home, travel and school bills. This exposes Malta to a very dangerous situation.","

Meanwhile, the two candidates most likely to be elected in the casual election which would follow Debono giving up his seat both made public statements announcing that they would participate in the casual election, but would immediately give up their seat if elected, to make way for Delia’s co-option. Right, I thought, Debono is about to be stitched up good and proper. He almost certainly knows this himself but can’t do anything about it because of that mess with the forged signatures.

Professor Cassar is a son-in-law of Eddie Fenech Adami, who Adrian Delia, the new party leader, has referenced constantly throughout his campaign and during his theatrical performance on stage in Floriana for the commemoration of Independence Day. Dr Delia’s comparison of himself to Dr Fenech Adami is viewed privately by members of that family as deeply offensive. Professor Cassar, whose wife’s brother, Beppe Fenech Adami, remains the Nationalist Party’s deputy leader pending the election of his replacement later this year, wrote (in translation): “I write to inform you that I am giving up my membership of the Nationalist Party and ask you to cancel my name from the list of life members. I have taken this decision for the reasons outlined below. “1. Adrian Delia has been elected party leader. While I respect the decision of the party’s electors, I have reservations about Dr Delia. Some of his choices make it impossible for me to remain a member of the party. “2.My doubts about Dr Delia, which he has not properly addressed, concern the matters about which the party’s Ethics Committee spoke, particularly his bank account in Jersey, the purpose of that account, the source of the money paid into it, and the ultimate destination of that money. I have serious concerns about his financial situation, the extent of his debts, and how – in his position as party leader – he can possibly settle those debts without becoming embroiled in other debts or obligations which may cause a conflict of interest. I have doubts and questions about how he intends to pay the Inland Revenue the many thousands of euros he has racked up in outstanding taxes and penalties. The fact that he has not paid the tax he owes raises doubts about his ethical standards and his suitability as leader of a political party. Nor has he kept his word when he promised to publish his tax returns. “3. I have doubts about various choices he may have made and about the sort of work in which he was involved. These doubts have persisted because the new party leader has failed to give a satisfactory explanation. “4. I am concerned about other cases which raise doubts about the party leader’s behaviour, notably those involving the Birkirkara Football Club and (Boris) Arcidiacono. Before his election, he assured us that there would be no problem finding a seat for him in parliament, and that the matter had been resolved, but after his election we found that the problem had yet to be addressed. This raises doubts about Dr Delia’s honesty, making it very much more difficult to believe him. “5. The factor which most worries me is his talk about “the fight against hatred”. This is being used to justify assaults on those who hold the new party leader to scrutiny or criticise him, including journalists and even members of the Nationalist Party itself. At a time when democracy is under threat, freedom of expression should be safeguarded more strongly.  “Instead we have dangerous talk which incites people against those who are critical or who hold a different opinion. Incitement against the so-called ‘establishment’, which means those who worked with dedication and honesty, has led to threats, insults and divisive antagonism. All criticism and any revelation of facts is being labelled “hatred” as a way of escaping the need to explain oneself. “This is the same tactic as that of describing facts and criticism as ‘fake news’, in which the primary purpose is to discredit all those make the criticism so that those who are criticised can escape the obligation to give a clear and honest explanation of their behaviour.  “In no time at all we have moved already into a personality cult in which any criticism is rebutted with personal attacks on the person making that criticism, making it clear that no criticism is tolerated at all. These are not the principles of democracy. They do not augur well for a political party that wishes to be healthy and open. The new way we were promised is changing before our very eyes into something that is not consistent with the principles that have long underpinned the Nationalist Party, and which our country now needs more than ever.  For these reasons, I feel I can no longer have anything to do with the Nationalist Party, and I am giving up my membership with immediate effect.”","

They want to wake up in the morning, they want to go to work and afterwards they want to enjoy their hobbies – some go to their garage to work on their car, others have their birds and things, others enjoy their motorsports…it’s a very simple, Mediterranean life and the PN must go back to its roots and understand that this is where we came from.” You will see from this that the new Nationalist Party leader equates ‘Maltese people’ solely with working-class men. Not even working-class women, but working-class men. The women simply don’t exist, and people of both sexes outside the working-class don’t exist either. We are not Maltese people. I am doubly not a Maltese person because I am a woman and also not working-class.  The interesting thing is that the narrow-minded Delia thinks that this is a portrayal of “a very simple, Mediterranean life” rather than the life of working-class men everywhere in the developed world. I think we are about to have a dovetailing of the Neo-Nationalist definition of ‘real Maltese people’ with that of the Labour Party: real Maltese people are the kind you used to see flooding the lanes at the Trade Fair 25 years ago. The rest of us are not real Maltese. We are fakes. Fascism, here we come. Pierre Portelli (see behind Delia) likes to go to work and then he likes to play with his birds, at Lm15 a shot.

They want to wake up in the morning, they want to go to work and afterwards they want to enjoy their hobbies – some go to their garage to work on their car, others have their birds and things, others enjoy their motorsports…it’s a very simple, Mediterranean life and the PN must go back to its roots and understand that this is where we came from.”You will see from this that the new Nationalist Party leader equates ‘Maltese people’ solely with working-class men. Not even working-class women, but working-class men. The women simply don’t exist, and people of both sexes outside the working-class don’t exist either.We are not Maltese people. I am doubly not a Maltese person because I am a woman and also not working-class. The interesting thing is that the narrow-minded Delia thinks that this is a portrayal of “a very simple, Mediterranean life” rather than the life of working-class men everywhere in the developed world.I think we are about to have a dovetailing of the Neo-Nationalist definition of ‘real Maltese people’ with that of the Labour Party: real Maltese people are the kind you used to see flooding the lanes at the Trade Fair 25 years ago. The rest of us are not real Maltese. We are fakes.Fascism, here we come.Pierre Portelli (see behind Delia) likes to go to work and then he likes to play with his birds, at Lm15 a shot. But he’s not a working-class man, and that means he’s not a real Maltese.  « previous postnext post »"

Previous Nationalist Party leaders relied solely on their state salary as Opposition leader or Prime Minister. “What’s the point of making gestures simply to give off an impression?” Delia told LovinMalta. “I appreciate that previous leaders refused a salary when the party’s finances were what they were, but there’s nothing wrong in me taking a salary if we manage to create new income streams and balance the party’s finances.” Party donors will now be funding his children’s school bills, his cars, his housekeeper and the interest on his bank loans – though, of course, it will be even more convenient if a single business operator can be found to simply hand him a cheque.","

90,90,2017,9,"Friday, 22 September 11:48 am",7,97477,https://daphnecaruanagalizia.com/2017/09/97477/,Nationalist Party assistant secretary-general/Delia campaigner forged signatures of party electors to collect their voting documents,"Malta is alight this morning at the news that Jean Pierre Debono, the Nationalist Party’s assistant secretary-general and the only member of the party administration who did not tender his resignation after the electoral defeat last June, forged the signatures of party electors to be able to collect their voting documents without their knowledge. The crime was discovered when one of those electors turned up at the Nationalist Party headquarters to collect his document, only to be told it had been picked up already by somebody using his proxy. He was adamant that he had not authorised anyone to do that. An internal inquiry before the election for the party leader last week, with checks on the list, revealed that the PN’s assistant secretary-general had forged not one but many signatures to collect other people’s voting documents in this manner. The information by the inquiry committee was kept secret and not revealed even to the party’s secretary-general, Rosette Thake, or its then leader, Simon Busuttil. This is particularly disturbing, because forgery of many signatures by the party’s assistant secretary-general so as to collect voting documents would have been grounds for invalidation of the proceedings. Instead the proceedings were allowed to proceed. This is what I mean about ‘bad people’ – and how no good can come from them. You simply cannot trust them at any level because they have no ethics and no barriers to action that decent people would consider obvious and non-negotiable. This shows not only a complete disregard for the basic rules – on the forgery of signatures by officials, for example, and on electoral procedures which are there for a reason – but also a cavalier attitude to the rights of others: you forge their signature and collect their document without their knowledge. We are dealing here with a set of persons who are all of a disgraceful piece in one way or another. Jean Pierre Debono’s nonchalant attitude towards forging the signatures of party electors, in his position as party assistant secretary-general, is completely of a piece with Adrian Delia’s obtaining, by hook or by crook, his wife’s proxy in 2006 and using it for the 11 years since, including last July for a deed of constitution of debt with HSBC to the tune of 7.3 million euros, of which she was probably not even aware, as otherwise she would have been present herself for something so serious, as was his partner Georg Sapiano’s wife. Some people became agitated when I gave such importance to the fact that Delia has been using his wife’s proxy for more than a decade. They thought it was entirely normal or not significant. But no, it is hugely significant. It is, in fact, one of the most significant pieces of information about him. The law was changed in 1993 precisely to avoid husbands going behind their wife’s back on material matters, as they could do up to that point. The law was changed for a reason and it has nothing to do with whether you trust your husband or not. There isn’t one law for women who trust their husband and another law for those who don’t. There is one law for all. Allowing a man to obtain his wife’s open proxy and to use it unhindered for 11 years is a way of circumventing that extremely important law. It should not be allowed. One of the first things this government should address is precisely this: that open proxies between a husband and wife are to be made illegal, and that any proxy given by a wife to a husband or vice versa should be specific, for X contract, and indicate in the proxy document itself that the person giving the power of attorney knows exactly the specific and once-only reason it is to be used for. But the wife gives the proxy of her own free will and can withdraw it at any time, I hear some people argue. No, of course not. Women who are completely financially dependent on their husband can be bullied into doing whatever their husband wants by the simple expedient, used by more husbands than you would think possible, of the threat of withdrawal of funds. The wife is left literally without money until she concedes to whatever it is her husband wants her to do. I think – through the experiences of so many women that I have listened to and know of – that this is exactly what we are looking at here.","

Borg Olivier, unlike his amenable and easy-going late brother Peter, has born a grudge against the Nationalist Party for four whole decades, since his father was defenestrated – not literally so – in a palace coup in 1977, after he lost a second general election and still refused to resign. He was replaced by Eddie Fenech Adami, who won against Guido Demarco, as a result of which his son Alexander has resented Fenech Adami ever since, a resentment he continued to project onto Lawrence Gonzi and Simon Busuttil. So when Adrian Delia crawled out of the woodwork and began shouting about clearing them all out and capturing the castle as an outsider, Borg Olivier must have thought all his Christmases had come at once. He crawled out of the woodwork too and began backing him vociferously. Because nothing is more wonderful than when two grudges coincide and become one. The fascinating thing is that in his speech Borg Olivier talks about how Delia will make the party a winner again. Again? The last elections in which the Nationalist Party was victorious were won not by his father but by Eddie Fenech Adami (four, and five if you count 1981) and Lawrence Gonzi (one). In fact, the Nationalist Party began winning elections as soon as his father was deposed. His father, George Borg Olivier, lost the 1971 and 1976 general elections and then had to be forcibly removed because he refused to step down with dignity. It was a terrible mess, and he died just three years later. The blame for the nightmare 16 years which Dom Mintoff inflicted on these islands can be laid squarely at Alexander Borg Olivier’s father’s door. In 1970, Prime Minister Borg Olivier was too busy running around with a fifth-rate English actress called Dawn Adams to campaign against the rising tide of Mintoffianism, while Mrs Borg Olivier caused an even greater amount of distraction by having an affair with a Roman Catholic priest by whom she became pregnant, giving birth in a sea of scandal just months before her husband faced Mintoff at the polls.  The net result was that practically the whole of Sliema, where the scandalous two continued to live in the same house despite one of them running around with an actress and the other having a baby by a priest, went out and voted Labour or didn’t vote at all, having been completely exposed to every last aspect of the scandal despite its not being reported by the mealy-mouthed press of the time. At one point, Mrs Borg Olivier was actually knocking on the neighbours’ doors and asking them not to vote for her husband because he was cheating on her so openly. And then their son comes on stage almost 50 years later and tells us that the scoundrel Delia is going to make the Nationalist Party as “great and victorious” as it was back then. I don’t wish to be rude or offensive, because some things are best left buried and not resurrected. But honestly, no wonder he thinks there’s nothing wrong with Adrian Delia.","
